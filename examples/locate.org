* locate

Find filenames quickly.

** Look for pattern in the database. Note: the database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  locate ${pattern}
#+END_SRC

** Recompute the database. You need to do it if you want to find recently added files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo updatedb
#+END_SRC
