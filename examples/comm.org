* comm

Select or reject lines common to two files. Both files must be sorted.

** Produce three tab-separated columns: lines only in first file, lines only in second file and common lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  comm ${file1} ${file2}
#+END_SRC

** Print only lines common to both files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  comm -12 ${file1} ${file2}
#+END_SRC

** Print only lines common to both files, reading one file from stdin:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cat ${file1} | comm -12 - ${file2}
#+END_SRC

** Get lines only found in first file, saving the result to a third file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  comm -23 ${file1} ${file2} > ${file1_only}
#+END_SRC

** Print lines only found in second file, when the files aren't sorted:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  comm -13 <(sort ${file1}) <(sort ${file2})
#+END_SRC
