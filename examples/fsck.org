* fsck

Check the integrity of a filesystem or repair it. The filesystem should be unmounted at the time the command is run.

** Check filesystem /dev/sda, reporting any damaged blocks:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fsck ${/dev/sda}
#+END_SRC

** Check filesystem /dev/sda, reporting any damaged blocks and interactively letting the user choose to repair each one:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fsck -r ${/dev/sda}
#+END_SRC

** Check filesystem /dev/sda, reporting any damaged blocks and automatically repairing them:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fsck -a ${/dev/sda}
#+END_SRC
