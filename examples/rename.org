* rename

Renames multiple files.

** Rename files using a Perl Common Regular Expression (substitute 'foo' with 'bar' wherever found):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rename ${'s/foo/bar/'} ${\*}
#+END_SRC

** Dry-run - display which renames would occur without performing them:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rename -n ${'s/foo/bar/'} ${\*}
#+END_SRC

** Force renaming even if the operation would overwrite existing files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rename -f ${'s/foo/bar/'} ${\*}
#+END_SRC

** Convert filenames to lower case (use `-f` in case-insensitive filesystems to prevent "already exists" errors):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' ${\*}
#+END_SRC

** Replace whitespace with underscores:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rename 's/\s+/_/g' ${\*}
#+END_SRC
