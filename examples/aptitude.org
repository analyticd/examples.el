** Install a new package and its dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  aptitude install ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Search for a package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  aptitude search ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Remove a package and all packages depending on it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  aptitude remove ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Do an `aptitude remove ${package}` and remove all config files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  aptitude purge ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Upgrade installed packages to newest available versions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  aptitude upgrade
#+END_SRC

** Upgrade installed packages (like `aptitude upgrade`) including removing obsolete packages and installing additional packages to meet new package dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  aptitude full-upgrade
#+END_SRC
