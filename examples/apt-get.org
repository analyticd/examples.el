* apt-get

Debian and Ubuntu package management utility.

** Synchronize list of packages and versions available. This should be run first, before running subsequent apt-get commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get update
#+END_SRC

** Install a new package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get install ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Remove a package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get remove ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Upgrade installed packages to newest available versions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get upgrade
#+END_SRC

** Upgrade installed packages (like "upgrade"), but remove obsolete packages and install additional packages to meet new dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get dist-upgrade
#+END_SRC
