* dirs

Displays or manipulates the directory stack.
The directory stack is a list of recently visited directories that can be manipulated with the `pushd` and `popd` commands.

** Display the directory stack with a space between each entry:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  dirs
#+END_SRC

** Display the directory stack with one entry per line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  dirs -p
#+END_SRC

** Display only the nth entry in the directory stack, starting at 0:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  dirs +${N}
#+END_SRC

** Clear the directory stack:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  dirs -c
#+END_SRC
