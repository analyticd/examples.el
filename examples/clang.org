* clang

Compiler for C, C++, and Objective-C source files. Can be used as a drop-in replacement for GCC.

** Compile a source code file into an executable binary:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  clang ${input_source.c} -o ${output_executable}
#+END_SRC

** Activate output of all errors and warnings:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  clang ${input_source.c} -Wall -o ${output_executable}
#+END_SRC

** Include libraries located at a different path than the source file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  clang ${input_source.c} -o ${output_executable} -I${header_path} -L${library_path} -l${library_name}
#+END_SRC
