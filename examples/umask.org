* umask

Manage the read/write/execute permissions that are masked out (i.e. restricted) for newly created files by the user.

** Display the current mask in octal notation:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  umask
#+END_SRC

** Display the current mask in symbolic (human-readable) mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  umask -S
#+END_SRC

** Change the mask symbolically to allow read permission for all users (the rest of the mask bits are unchanged):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  umask ${a+r}
#+END_SRC

** Set the mask (using octal) to restrict no permissions for the file's owner, and restrict all permissions for everyone else:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  umask ${077}
#+END_SRC
