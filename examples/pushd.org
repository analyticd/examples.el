* pushd

Place a directory on a stack so it can be accessed later.

** Switch to directory and push it on the stack:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pushd < ${directory}
#+END_SRC

** Switch first and second directories on the stack:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pushd
#+END_SRC

** Rotate stack by making the 5th element the top of the stack:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pushd +4
#+END_SRC
