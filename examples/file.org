* file

Determine file type.

** Give a description of the type of the specified file.  Works fine for files with no file extension:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  file ${filename}
#+END_SRC

** Look inside a zipped file and determine the file type(s) inside:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  file -z ${foo.zip}
#+END_SRC

** Allow file to work with special or device files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  file -s ${filename}
#+END_SRC

** Don't stop at first file type match; keep going until the end of the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  file -k ${filename}
#+END_SRC
