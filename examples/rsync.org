#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rsync ${remote_host_name}:${remote_file_location} ${local_file_location}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rsync -az ${path/to/file} ${remote_host_name}:${remote_host_location}
#+END_SRC

** Transfer a directory and all its children from a remote to local:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rsync -r ${remote_host_name}:${remote_folder_location} ${local_folder_location}
#+END_SRC
