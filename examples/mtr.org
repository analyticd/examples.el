* mtr

Combined traceroute and ping tool.

** Traceroute to a host and continuously ping all intermediary hops:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mtr ${host}
#+END_SRC

** Disable IP address and host name mapping:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mtr -n ${host}
#+END_SRC

** Generate output after pinging each hop 10 times:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mtr -w ${host}
#+END_SRC

** Force IP IPv4 or IPV6:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mtr -4 ${host}
#+END_SRC
