* patch

Patch a file (or files) with a diff file.
Note that diff files contain both the target filenames and list of changes.

** Apply a patch:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch < ${patch_file}.diff
#+END_SRC

** Apply a patch to current directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch -p1 < ${patch_file}.diff
#+END_SRC

** Apply the reverse of a patch:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  patch -R < ${patch_file}.diff
#+END_SRC
