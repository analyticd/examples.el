* pkill

Signal process by name.
Mostly used for stopping processes.

** Kill all processes which match:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pkill -9 ${process_name}
#+END_SRC

** Kill all processes which match their full command instead of just the process name:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pkill -9 -f "${command_name}"
#+END_SRC

** Send SIGUSR1 signal to processes which match:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pkill -USR1 ${process_name}
#+END_SRC
