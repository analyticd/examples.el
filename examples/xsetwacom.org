* xsetwacom

Command line tool to change settings for Wacom pen tablets at runtime.

** List all the available wacom devices. The device name is in the first column:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xsetwacom list
#+END_SRC

** Set Wacom area to specific screen. Get name of the screen with `xrandr`:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xsetwacom set "${device name}" MapToOutput ${screen}
#+END_SRC

** Set mode to relative (like a mouse) or absolute (like a pen) mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xsetwacom set "${device name}" Mode "${Relative|Absolute}"
#+END_SRC

** Rotate the input (useful for tablet-PC when rotating screen) by 0|90|180|270 degrees from "natural" rotation:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xsetwacom set "${device name}" Rotate ${none|half|cw|ccw}
#+END_SRC

** Set button to only work when the tip of the pen is touching the tablet:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xsetwacom set "${device name}" TabletPCButton "on"
#+END_SRC
