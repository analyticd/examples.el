* lsof

Lists open files and the corresponding processes.
Note: In most cases, you need root privilege (or use sudo) because you want to list files opened by others.

** Find the processes that have a given file open:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  lsof ${/path/to/file}
#+END_SRC

** Find the process that opened a local internet port:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  lsof -i :${port}
#+END_SRC

** Only output the process PID:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  lsof -t ${/path/to/file}
#+END_SRC

** List files opened by the given user:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  lsof -u ${username}
#+END_SRC

** List files opened by the given command or process:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  lsof -c ${process_or_command_name}
#+END_SRC
