* umount

Revokes access to an entire filesystem mounted to a directory.
A filesystem cannot be unmounted when it is busy.

** Unmount a filesystem:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  umount ${path/to/device_file}
#+END_SRC

** OR:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  umount ${path/to/mounted_directory}
#+END_SRC

** Unmount all mounted filesystems (dangerous!):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  umount -a
#+END_SRC
