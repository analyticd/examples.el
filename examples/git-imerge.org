* git-imerge

Perform a merge or rebase between two git branches incrementally.
Conflicts between branches are tracked down to pairs of individual commits, to simplify conflict resolution.

** Start imerge-based rebase (checkout the branch to be rebased, first):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git imerge rebase ${branch_to_rebase_onto}
#+END_SRC

** Start imerge-based merge (checkout the branch to merge into, first):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git imerge merge ${branch_to_be_merged}
#+END_SRC

** Show ASCII diagram of in-progress merge or rebase:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git imerge diagram
#+END_SRC

** Continue imerge operation after resolving conflicts (`git add` the conflicted files, first):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git imerge continue --no-edit
#+END_SRC

** Wrap up the imerge operation, after all conflicts are resolved:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git imerge finish
#+END_SRC
