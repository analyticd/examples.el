* redshift

Adjust the color temperature of your screen according to your surroundings.

** Turn on Redshift with 5700K temperature during day and 3600K at night:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  redshift -t ${5700}:${3600}
#+END_SRC

** Turn on Redshift with a manually-specified custom location:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  redshift -l ${latitude}:${longitude}
#+END_SRC

** Turn on Redshift with 70% screen brightness during day and 40% brightness at night:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  redshift -b ${0.7}:${0.4}
#+END_SRC

** Turn on Redshift with custom gamma levels (between 0 and 1):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  redshift -g ${red}:${green}:${blue}
#+END_SRC

** Turn on Redshift with a constant unchanging color temperature:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  redshift -O ${temperature}
#+END_SRC
