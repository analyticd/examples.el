* ag

The Silver Searcher. Like ack, but faster.

** Find files containing "foo", and print the line matches in context:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ag foo
#+END_SRC

** Find files containing "foo", but only list the filenames:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ag -l foo
#+END_SRC

** Find files containing "FOO" case-insensitively, and print only the match, rather than the whole line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ag -i -o FOO
#+END_SRC

** Find "foo" in files with a name matching "bar":

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ag foo -G bar
#+END_SRC

** Find files whose contents match a regular expression:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ag '^ba(r|z)$'
#+END_SRC

** Find files with a name matching "foo":

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ag -g foo
#+END_SRC
