* ed

The original Unix text editor.

** Start ed, editing an empty document (which can be saved as a new file in the current directory):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ed
#+END_SRC

** Start ed, editing an empty document, with `:` as a command prompt indicator:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ed -p :
#+END_SRC

** Start ed editing an existing file (this shows the byte count of the loaded file):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ed -p : ${path/to/file}
#+END_SRC

** Toggle the printing of error explanations. (By default, explanations are not printed and only a `?` appears):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  H
#+END_SRC

** Add text to the current document. Mark completion by entering a period by itself in a new line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  a<Enter>${text_to_insert}<Enter>.
#+END_SRC

** Print the entire document (`,` is a shortcut to the range `1,$` which covers the start to the end of the document):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ,p
#+END_SRC

** Write the current document to a new file (the filename can be omitted if `ed` was called with an existing file):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  w ${filename}
#+END_SRC

** Quit ed:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  q
#+END_SRC
