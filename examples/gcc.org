* gcc

Preprocesses and compiles C and C++ source files, then assembles and links them together.

** Compile multiple source files into executable:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gcc ${source1.c} ${source2.c} -o ${executable}
#+END_SRC

** Allow warnings, debug symbols in output:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gcc ${source.c} -Wall -Og -o ${executable}
#+END_SRC

** Include libraries from a different path:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gcc ${source.c} -o ${executable} -I${header_path} -L${library_path} -l${library_name}
#+END_SRC

** Compile source code into Assembler instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gcc -S ${source.c}
#+END_SRC

** Compile source code without linking:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gcc -c ${source.c}
#+END_SRC
