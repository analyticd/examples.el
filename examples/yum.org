* yum

Package management utility for RHEL, Feodra, and CentOS (for older versions).

** Synchronize list of packages and versions available. This should be run first, before running subsequent yum commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  yum update
#+END_SRC

** Install a new package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  yum install ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Install a new package and assume yes to all questions (also works with update, great for automated updates):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  yum -y install ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Remove a package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  yum remove ${package}
#+END_SRC

** Upgrade installed packages to newest available versions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  yum upgrade
#+END_SRC
