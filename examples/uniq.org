* uniq

Output the unique lines from the given input or file.
Since it does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent, we need to sort them first.

** Display each line once:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sort ${file} | uniq
#+END_SRC

** Display only unique lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sort ${file} | uniq -u
#+END_SRC

** Display only duplicate lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sort ${file} | uniq -d
#+END_SRC

** Display number of occurences of each line along with that line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sort ${file} | uniq -c
#+END_SRC

** Display number of occurences of each line, sorted by the most frequent:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sort ${file} | uniq -c | sort -nr
#+END_SRC
