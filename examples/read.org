* read

BASH builtin for retrieving data from standard input.

** Store data that you type from the keyboard:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  read ${variable}
#+END_SRC

** Store each of the next lines you enter as values of an array:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  read -a ${array}
#+END_SRC

** Enable backspace and GNU readline hotkeys when entering input with read:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  read -e ${variable}
#+END_SRC

** Specify the number of maximum characters to be read:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  read -n ${character_count} ${variable}
#+END_SRC

** Use a specific character as a delimiter instead of a new line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  read -d ${new_delimiter} ${variable}
#+END_SRC
