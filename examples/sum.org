* sum

Compute checksums and the number of blocks for a file.
A predecessor to the more modern `cksum`.

** Compute a checksum with BSD-compatible algorithm and 1024-byte blocks:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sum ${file}
#+END_SRC

** Compute a checksum with System V-compatible algorithm and 512-byte blocks:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sum --sysv ${file}
#+END_SRC
