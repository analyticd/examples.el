* pass

Safely store and read passwords or other sensitive data easily.
All data is GPG-encrypted, and managed with a git repository.

** Initialize the storage using a gpg-id for encryption:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pass init ${gpg_id}
#+END_SRC

** Save a new password (prompts you for the value without echoing it):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pass insert ${path/to/data}
#+END_SRC

** Copy a password (first line of the data file) to the clipboard:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pass -c ${path/to/data}
#+END_SRC

** List the whole store tree:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pass
#+END_SRC

** Generate a new random password with a given length, and copy it to the clipboard:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pass generate -c ${path/to/data} ${num}
#+END_SRC

** Run any git command against the underlying store repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pass git ${git_arguments}
#+END_SRC
