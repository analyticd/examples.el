* tree

Show the contents of the current directory as a tree.

** Show files and directories with a depth of 'num' (where 1 means the current directory):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  tree -L ${num}
#+END_SRC

** Show directories only:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  tree -d
#+END_SRC

** Show hidden files too:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  tree -a
#+END_SRC

** Print human readable size of files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  tree -h
#+END_SRC

** Print the full path for each file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  tree -f
#+END_SRC

** Print the tree without lines and indentation. Useful when used with -f:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  tree -i
#+END_SRC
