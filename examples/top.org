* top

Display dynamic real-time information about running processes.

** Start top:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  top
#+END_SRC

** Do not show any idle or zombie processes:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  top -i
#+END_SRC

** Show only processes owned by given user:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  top -u ${user_name}
#+END_SRC

** Show only the processes with the given PID(s), passed as a comma-separated list. (Normally you wouldn't know PIDs off hand. This example picks the PIDs from the process name):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  top -p $(pgrep -d ',' ${process_name})
#+END_SRC

** Get help about interactive commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ?
#+END_SRC
