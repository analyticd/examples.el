* strace

Troubleshooting tool for tracing system calls.

** Start tracing a specific process by its PID:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  strace -p ${pid}
#+END_SRC

** Trace a process and filter output by system call:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  strace -p ${pid} -e ${system call name}
#+END_SRC

** Count time, calls, and errors for each system call and report a summary on program exit:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  strace -p ${pid} -c
#+END_SRC

** Show the time spent in every system call:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  strace -p ${pid} -T
#+END_SRC
