* diff

Compare files and directories.

** Compare files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  diff ${file1} ${file2}
#+END_SRC

** Compare files, ignoring white spaces:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  diff -w ${file1} ${file2}
#+END_SRC

** Compare files, showing differences side by side:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  diff -y ${file1} ${file2}
#+END_SRC

** Compare directories recursively:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  diff -r ${directory1} ${directory2}
#+END_SRC

** Compare directories, only showing the names of files that differ:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  diff -rq ${directory1} ${directory2}
#+END_SRC
