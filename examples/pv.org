* pv

Monitor the progress of data through a pipe.

** Print the contents of the file and display a progress bar:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pv ${file}
#+END_SRC

** Measure the speed and amount of data flow between pipes (`-s` is optional):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  command1 | pv -s ${expected_amount_of_data_for_eta} | command2
#+END_SRC

** Filter a file, see both progress and amount of output data:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pv -cN in ${big_text_file} | grep ${pattern} | pv -cN out > ${filtered_file}
#+END_SRC

** Attach to an already running process and see its file reading progress:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pv -d ${PID}
#+END_SRC

** Read an erroneous file, skip errors as `dd conv=sync,noerror` would:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pv -EE ${path/to/faulty_media} > image.img
#+END_SRC

** Stop reading after reading specified amount of data, rate limit to 1K/s:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pv -L 1K -S ${maximum_file_size_to_be_read}
#+END_SRC
